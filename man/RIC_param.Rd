\title{A set of parameters ro estimate relative vulnerability to capture by gillnet dependent on fish size}
\format{
A list with 4 parts: RIC_meshes, theta, rel.power are for using predict_Millar() and p_gam are stored gam model predictions
\describe{
  \item{RIC_meshes}{A vector of standard meshes in in used in RIC gillnets, numeric value}
  \item{theta}{A vecotr of 5 parameters needed for bilognorm Millar model}
  \item{rel.power}{A vector of 7 parameters to describe relative fishing power of each mesh for bilognorm Millar model}
  \item{p_gam}{A named vector describing the relative vulnerability to capture by gillnets for each fork length (mm) using a GAM model on mark-recap data}
